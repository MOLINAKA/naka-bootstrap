                <p >In Khmer, my full name, “Lim Molinaka”, doesn’t mean anything and it seems as simple as
                    the blue sky, however, the middle part of my name, “Moli” has its meaning as special as the moon. It
                    means fortune and talented. My dad is the one that put this name for me. Since I was about years
                    old, my name was just “Lim Moli”, but because I had a lot of illness, so my dad think that there’s
                    something wrong with this name, so he added “Naka” to that name. Compare my current name to my past
                    name, I would love to have the current name instead and there are a few reasons to this, as you read
                    more, you will find out why.

                    I feel so lucky and satisfied to have this current name because it’s simple, uncomplicated to call
                    and spell, not too short or not too long, and as you know that I don’t like to have the same name
                    with anyone, so since i was born until now, I’ve never seen people who have the same name as me
                    because it’s so rare. If there is people that have this name as well, I really want to know what are
                    they like, are they the same me or how’re they different from me or what is their special part as we
                    have the same name. Moreover, In my family, there is no one that have the name as long as me, and i
                    think my name is better than my sister and my brother because there are many people that have the
                    same name as them, except me.

                    At last, I think this name define me really well and I would not want to have another name instead
                    of this, also i don’t know what’s other name to put instead this because I just don’t want to have
                    the same name as anyone else.</p>
